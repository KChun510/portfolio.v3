I think all we need is a user sessions table. 

When a user adds a song. 

Sessions table:
- Assign a userID PK.
- Assign a userSession. Sessions key in DB, with sesssion in there browser. 

UserInfo table:
- userID, as PK and auto increment.
- userTag, as Text.
- song_name, that they added.

Cookie flow:
- option 1:
  Only assign a user cookie, when a user suggest a song.
  Schema:
  - session_id, user_tag, song_name


Plan:
1) Set the new table up.
2) Be able to set cookie in user browser ( On song creation ).
3) Store cookie data in db.
4) Check browser for cookie + check db.
  - If cookie matches. Then you can edit the song you added. ( Via song name )
